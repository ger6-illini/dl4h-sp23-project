    "In this project, we aim to reproduce the paper [*Learning Task for Multitask Learning: Heterogeneous Patient Populations in the ICU* by (Suresh et al, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02878). In this paper, the authors propose a novel two-step pipeline to predict in-hospital mortality across patient populations with different characteristics. The first step of the pipeline divides patients into relevant non-overlapping cohorts in an unsupervised way using a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder followed by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The second step of the pipeline predicts in-hospital mortality for each patient cohort identified in the previous step using an LSTM based multi-task learning model where every cohort is considered a different task.\n",
    "The paper claims that by applying this pipeline there will be better predictive results when compared to a model applied to the aggregate population using a single task learning model. According to the authors, the better performance given by this pipeline is due to the combination of a multi-task learning model leveraging shared knowledge across distinct patient groups and the way how those groups were created, i.e., identification using a data-driven method rather than relying on domain knowledge or auxiliary labels."

    "This paper uses the publicly available [MIMIC-III database](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635) which contains clinical data in a critical care setting. After reviewing the paper in detail, we decided to use [MIMIC-Extract](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08322), an open source pipeline by (Wang et al., 2020) for transforming the raw EHR data into usable [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes containing hourly time series of vitals and laboratory measurements after performing unit conversion, outlier handling, and aggregation of semantically similar features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the MIMIC-Extract pipeline misses two features the [paper code](https://github.com/mit-caml/multitask-patients) makes use of:\n",
    "* `timecmo_chart` which indicates the timestamp of a patient after being declared in CMO (Comfort Measures Only) state. This feature comes from a MIMIC-III concept table called `code_status`.\n",
    "* `sapsii` which contains the SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) II for the patient. This feature comes from another MIMIC-III concept table called `sapsii`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, there are three data files needed to run this notebook:\n",
    "* `all_hourly_data.h5`, an HDF file resulting from running the MIMIC-Extract pipeline which is publicly available in GCP using [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/mimic_extract) and referenced in the [MIMIC-Extract github repo](https://github.com/MLforHealth/MIMIC_Extract).\n",
    "* `code_status.csv`, a CSV file holding the MIMIC concept table `CODE_STATUS` that can be generated following the instructions in [this link within the MIT-LCP github repo](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/main/mimic-iii/concepts#generating-the-concepts-in-postgresql).\n",
    "* `sapsii.csv`, a CSV file holding the MIMIC concept table `SAPSII` that can be generated following the instructions in [this link within the MIT-LCP github repo](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/main/mimic-iii/concepts#generating-the-concepts-in-postgresql).\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions used in this notebook assume the three files listed above are in the folder `../data/` by default. However, location can be changed using arguments to the functions that process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code needed to replicate the paper is in [our github repo](https://github.com/ger6-illini/dl4h-sp23-team27-project) inside a Python module called `mtl_patients`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function from that module we will start using is `get_summaries()`. This function returns three summaries as dataframes:\n",
    "1. A summary providing some statistics of all patients broken by careunit.\n",
    "2. A summary providing some statistics of all patients broken by SAPS-II score quartile.\n",
    "3. A summary providing some statistics of the 29 distinct physiological measurements used in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "These summaries need two arguments to be created:\n",
    "* `cutoff_hours` (default 24) which is the minimum number of hours a patient needs to stay in the ICU to be considered part of a cohort.\n",
    "* `gap_hours` (default 12) which is the number of hours between the end of `cutoff_hours` and the moment a model can start making a mortality prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of these two arguments is his impact in the exception criteria used in the paper. In particular, the paper:\n",
    "1. Excludes all patients that met the in-hospital mortality criteria before `cutoff period` + `gap period`.\n",
    "2. Excludes patients that were discharged before `cutoff period` + `gap period`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in-hospital mortality criteria used in the paper is an extended one and not just considers patients who died but also patients with a CMO (Comfort Measures Only) note. That is considered in the summaries creation as well."

As it can be seen, the four quartiles have the ranges $[0, 22], [23, 32], [33, 41], [42, 118] $. This was included in the authors code but not in the paper. It seems the class imbalance might have been the primary reason. As it is evident from the summary, most of the patients are in quartile $3$ since they are in an ICU and is expected their values are on the high side."

    "In order to identify meaningful patient cohorts, the paper proposes to process the raw patient data in such a way that the result is a 3D matrix of shape $(P \\times T \\times F)$ where $P$ represents the number of patients, $T$ the number of timesteps, and $F$ the number of features as depicted in the figure below (in blue) which is partially based on Figure 2 of the original paper. All numbers shown in the figure below correspond to a specific experiment published in the paper in which the observation window is limited to the first $24$ hours (cutoff period) after a patient goes into a careunit and there is a gap of $12$ hours (gap period) between the end of the observation window and the beginning of the prediction window where the prediction task is in-hospital mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparation of the data to get the 3D (blue) matrix is performed by a function called `prepare_data()` inside the `mtl_patients.py` module. This preparation consists of the following transformations taken from the paper and the author's code reference implementation:\n",
    "1. Calculation of the mortality flag (prediction label) and mortality time for every patient in the dataset using an *extended* definition of mortality: death, a note of \"Do Not Resuscitate\" (DNR), or a note of \"Comfort Measures Only\" (CMO). In case any of these conditions are met for a patient, the corresponding mortality label is set to *True* and the corresponding mortality time is considered as the earliest time of any of the three conditions. After reviewing in detail the author's code implementation it seems mortality is based on deathtime and a CMO note but not DNR. However, the calculation of the time of death is based on the earliest time of the three conditions.\n",
    "2. Data used for the prediction is only limited to the first certain amount of hours after a patient goes into the ICU. This amount of hours is called inside the code \"a cutoff period\" (observation window) and defines the period of data used to train all models. In addition, there is another number of hours called inside the code \"the gap period\" which represents the time between the end of the observation window and the beginning of the prediction window to prevent label leakage. All patients that died under the *extended* definition before the cutoff period plus the gap period or stayed less than the cutoff period are excluded from the experiment as part of this step. Also, all patients under the age of 15 are excluded (this is already part of the exclusion criteria of the MIMIC-Extract pipeline).\n",
    "3. There are 29 vitals/labs timeseries selected by the paper. Only data within the cutoff period for vitals/labs is kept and rest is removed. This will be used for the rest of the machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "4. All vitals/labs values are converted to z-scores so they all have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Those z-scores are rounded to the closest integer and clipped between $-4$ and $4$ or set to $9$ in case of `NaN`. This allows to map every vital/lab measurement (a float) to one of ten possible values $[-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9]$, so they can be converted to dummy values. After dummifying the vitals/labs, column for the $9$ values (`NaN`) is removed, and the resulting matrix is sparse and containing either $0$s or $1$s.\n",
    "5. Every patient is padded with rows of zeroes for those hours that are missed. For example, if a patient only has vitals/labs for the first ten hours and the cutoff period is 24, code adds fourteen hours (rows) with zeroes for that patient. In the end, the matrix will have a size of $P \\times T \\times F$ as expected by the subsequent models.\n",
    "6. Finally, static data (gender, age, and ethnicity) is converted to integers representing categories and dummified. In case of age, there are four buckets established; $(10, 30), (30, 50), (50, 70), (70, \\infty)$; while ethnicity is broken into five buckets (asian, white, hispanic, black, other).\n",
    "7. Cohort assignments based on first careunit or Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score quartile is calculated for each patient and returned as well."

This model consists of an LSTM layer with same number of cells (16) as the baseline model, to ensure the comparison is fair, connected to as many dense layers as population subgroups (cohorts). Each of these cohorts is considered a *task* and authors propose training these models on multiple tasks simultaneously in contrast to the baseline model with just one dense layer. The benefit of this approach according to the authors is the ability to share knowledge learned from one task (cohort) to rest of tasks under the assumption that the subpopulations used are distinct enough with relation to the outcome learned (mortality) that such shared knowledge truly exists. A representation of the multi-task learning model is shown below:"
