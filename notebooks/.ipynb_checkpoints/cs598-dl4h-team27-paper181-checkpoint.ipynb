    "In this project, we aim to reproduce the paper [*Learning Task for Multitask Learning: Heterogeneous Patient Populations in the ICU* by (Suresh et al, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02878). In this paper, the authors propose a novel two-step pipeline to predict in-hospital mortality across patient populations with different characteristics. The first step of the pipeline divides patients into relevant non-overlapping cohorts in an unsupervised way using a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder followed by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The second step of the pipeline predicts in-hospital mortality for each patient cohort identified in the previous step using an LSTM based multi-task learning model where every cohort is considered a different task.\n",
    "The paper claims that by applying this pipeline, the multi-task learning model can leverage shared knowledge across the distinct patient groups identified and it can work effectively since the groups were obtained using a data-driven method rather than relying in domain knowledge or auxiliary labels."

After reviewing the paper in detail, we decided to use [MIMIC-Extract](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08322), an open source pipeline by (Wang et al., 2020) for transforming the raw EHR data into usable Pandas dataframes containing hourly time series of vitals and laboratory measurements after performing unit conversion, outlier handling, and aggregation of semantically similar features.\n",

    "In the previous summary, patients were broken based on the quartile of the SAPS-II score assigned to them. As it can be seen, the two quartiles have the ranges $[0, 22], [23, 32], [33, 41], [42, 118] $. This was included in the authors code but not in the paper. It seems the class imbalance might have been the primary reason. As it is evident from the summary, most of the patients are in quartile $3$ since they are in an ICU and is expected their values are on the high side."
